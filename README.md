## Dataset:
•	Telco Customer Churn dataset
•	Around 7,000 customer records
•	Target variable: Churn (Yes / No)

## Steps Performed:
•	Data cleaning and preprocessing
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Feature engineering and encoding
•	Model training using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
•	Model evaluation using classification report, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC score
•	Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
